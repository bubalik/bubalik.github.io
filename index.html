                        </header>

                        <p> The Jack Russell Terrier was developed in Devonshire, England, in the early 1800’s. In 1819, a young John (Jack) Russell was wandering the Oxford University campus shortly before he was to sit for an examination for which he apparently was ill-prepared. He came across a milkman accompanied by an unusual, but adorable, terrier bitch. Russell found her so delightful that he bought her on the spot and named her “Trump.” Trump became the foundation for the Jack Russell Terrier breed. Based upon her appearance (which was similar to a Wire Fox Terrier but with shorter legs and a wider skull), Trump is thought to have been a cross between a Black-and-Tan Terrier and a Fox Terrier.

                        <p> General Appearance
                            The Jack Russell Terrier is a small, agile, active hunting terrier, built to go to ground. The length of back from withers to set-on of tail is slightly longer than the dog’s height at the withers. The length of the front leg (measured from point of elbow to the ground) is approximately equal to one-half of the dog’s height at the withers. The body is capable of being spanned by an average man’s hands placed behind the front legs. The head is moderately broad, with a flat skull, a well-defined stop, and a powerful muzzle that is slightly shorter than the skull. Ears are button or drop, and very mobile.
